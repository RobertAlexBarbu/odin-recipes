        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grilled chicken breasts with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella tucked between two slices of a ciabatta roll slathered with pestoâ€¦it is everything a caprese sandwich should be!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 heirloom tomato</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup basil pesto, divided</li>
            <li>4 ciabatta rolls</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees C (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Thinly slice chicken breasts in half and season with Italian seasoning and salt. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut heirloom tomato and mozzarella cheese into four 1/3-inch thick slices. Set out tomato slices on a baking sheet and top with mozzarella slices. Add to oven and bake for the last 10 minutes with the chicken. Remove chicken from oven.</li>
            <li>Turn oven to broil and broil tomatoes and cheese, until cheese has melted, 2 to 3 minutes. If desired, add ciabatta buns and toast under the broiler until browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>To assemble the sandwiches, place a chicken filet onto the ciabatta bun, top with tomato and melted mozzarella, and 1 tablespoon pesto.</li>
        </ol>
