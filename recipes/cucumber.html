        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1(0.7 ounce) package dry Italian salad dressing mix</li>
            <li>2 loaves French bread, cut into 1 inch slices</li>
            <li>2 medium cucumbers, sliced</li>
            <li>1 pinch dried dill weed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, mayonnaise and Italian dressing mix. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>Spread the cream cheese blend onto slices of French bread. Top with a cucumber slice, and sprinkle with dill. You can make as many or few as you like. the cream cheese mixture keeps for about a week in the refrigerator so you can make them over and over again!</li>
